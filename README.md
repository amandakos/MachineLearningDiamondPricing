# MachineLearningDiamondPricing
Using the 'diamonds' dataset in the seaborn package of Python, a train-test-split model is created to predict diamond pricing.
Many packages in Python have amazing features to help a user create predictive models.
Here, a machine learning model is created to help predict diamond pricing based on carat, cut, color, and clarity.
The seaborn package has a diamonds dataset that is used to make the model.
First, to create the arrays needed for the linear regression model, all variables used need to be coded as numeric values.
Then the arrays are created and fed to the train-test-split model.
The regresssion is ran and analyzed with a graph and accuracy score.
Errors are examined (MAE, MSE, and RMSE).
Finally, a K-Fold Cross Validation is used to check the model.
